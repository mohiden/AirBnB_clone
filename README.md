# **AirBnB clone**

+ The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

+ Implement, only some features to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

+ After 4 months, you will have **a complete web application composed by:**

+    A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
+    A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
+    A database or files that store data (data = objects)
+    An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# **STEPS :**

# **The console**

+ create your data model
manage ( create, update, destroy, etc ) objects via a console / command interpreter
+ store and persist objects to a file ( JSON file )
+ The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. 
+ This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. 
+ This means: from your console code ( the command interpreter itself ) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention ( take care ) of how your objects are stored.

+ This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

+ The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

# **Web static**

+ learn HTML/CSS
+ create the HTML of your application
+ create template of each object

# **MySQL storage**

+ replace the file storage by a Database storage
+ map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

# **Web framework - templating**

+ create your first web server in Python
+ make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

# **RESTful API**

+ expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
+ manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

# **Web dynamic**

+ learn JQuery
+ load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

# **Files and Directories**

+ **models directory** will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
+ **tests directory** will contain all unit tests.
+ **console.py** file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
+ **models/base_model.py** file is the base class of all our models. 
+ It contains common elements:
+ attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
+ methods: save() and to_json()
+ **models/engine directory** will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
